      "Birds are not only one of the most magnificent creatures but also serve as crucial indicators of ecosystem health. However, bird populations are declining as habitats are being lost due to deforestation and rapid urbanisation. Yet, there is a lack of an efficient means of tracking bird population data to aid with conservation efforts and analysis of bird species distribution. Conventional methods are heavily reliant on bird-watchers, with some innovative approaches including the use of stationary cameras, which limit the scope of detection. This research introduces a novel approach to this problem, using a small, radio-controlled mobile platform (boat), equipped with cameras and AI detection algorithms to automatically capture and store images of birds. These images can then be classified with the help of AI classification algorithms, which have been specifically trained on birds commonly found in Bangalore and India. By developing multiple prototypes, testing different cameras, and implementing various propulsion methods in order to minimise noise, the rover has been very specifically designed for this use case. By integrating computer vision, machine learning, and engineering, my rover provides a scalable solution for ornithological research and conservation efforts. This study further uses data from the device collected at water bodies in Karnataka to analyse habitat suitability and potential variables causing decline by using species distribution modelling (SDMs) with models like MaxEnt to help conservationists identify the requirements of particular bird species. This study provides an approach that makes the process of bird monitoring more systematic, effective, and scalable than existing methods.",

      "All hospitals need wheelchairs to help patients who cannot move independently. Currently, attendants are needed to push manual wheelchairs, which limits the nursing staff available for critical care. This research is working to develop a novel autonomous wheelchair, which is capable of navigating indoor hospital environments without assistance. Hence, allowing the nursing staff to attend to more urgent patients. An ESP32 microcontroller controls two electric motors which is attached to the wheelbase allowing for smooth movement. Meanwhile, infrared (IR) technology was explored and developed, using a 940nm IR emitter beacon. While effective at short range, IR is hindered by external, ambient interference, which constrains the range. A near-infrared (NIR) camera was also tested, coded to capture an environmental heat map. Similarly, the range was insufficient for broader navigation.For obstacle avoidance and detection, ultrasonic sensors were used, providing precise distance measurements up to 2 meters away. This allows the system respond to dynamic variables of its surrounding. As an alternative to IR, the system utilizes radio signal strength-based localization. Specifically, Wi-Fi fingerprinting, which uses Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values from various access points to estimate the wheelchair's location. As Wi-Fi is a necessity, this method allows for awareness around a large indoor area without any additional infrastructure.However, radio positioning lacks fine resolution and precision. Hence, it is used in conjunction with LiDAR and ultrasonic sensors to enable wall-following, door detection, and safe path planning. The fusion of multiple sensors creates a novel solution to indoor patient transport systems (IPS), offering a low cost and reliable system.",

  longDescription:
    "AvianEye was developed as part of my internship at Siemensâ€™ prestigious PAMC (Platform and Module Competency) Lab, where I worked at the intersection of embedded systems and artificial intelligence. The drone was designed as a professional-grade environmental monitoring platform, integrating AI-driven bird detection and classification with robust hardware foundations. I contributed extensively to embedded software, PCB design, and implementing communication protocols such as UART, SPI, and I2C. I also developed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow, tested AI models in real-world conditions, and collaborated closely with Siemens engineers on AI integration into embedded workflows. This project not only provided me with invaluable industry-grade skills but also served as the direct foundation for my BirdRover research, which went on to win the IRIS Grand Award and represent India at Regeneron ISEF.",
